# Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

# Example 1:
#
# Input: s = "abcabcbb"
# Output: 3
# Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
# Example 2:
#
# Input: s = "bbbbb"
# Output: 1
# Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
# Example 3:
#
# Input: s = "pwwkew"
# Output: 3
# Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
# Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
# Example 4:
#
# Input: s = ""
# Output: 0
